            with JavaScript and React. I'm always hungry for more knowledge and
            eager to level up my skills to become an expert in the field. I'm

            <p>
              I was born in Poland, I have raised in small village called
              "Straszewo". Recently I have moved to Germany. My favorite movie
              is Pulp Fiction, and my favorite sport is football. I am a huge
              fan of Juventus FC! In my free time, I enjoy reading books and
              developing myself in every possible way!

            <span>Programing</span>
            <p>
              I wrote my first HTML when I was 13. It was a simple website
              dedicated to Metallica. My first exposure to programming was in
              school when I was 16. Back then I wrote this code:
              <code>
                program HelloWorld;
                <br />
                uses crt;
                <br />
                <br />
                begin <br />
                &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;writeln('Hello, world.');
                <br />
                &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;readln;
                <br />
                end.
                <br />
              </code>
              Do you know, what language it is? ðŸ˜Š
              <br />
              <br />
              When I was 18 I had small contact with C++. After school, I
              totally forget about programming and focused on other things. I
              come back to programming at beginning of 2022. I started with
              Python. I wrote a few small programs, and learned about basics
              like OOP, FP, data structures, etc. Finally I moved to Django and
              soaked in creating nice-looking templates. I had far more
              satisfaction from doing front-end than back-end, so I decided to
              learn more about HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. <br />
